## Chapter 13, Page 403 - Fixing the reference to `ord` array

There should be a reference calling to the `ord` array as `ord_text` in the `generate_hash` function.

Incorrect code is:
```
else:
    hash_text[i] = ((hash_text[i-1] - ord_text[i-1]) + ord[i+len_pattern-1]) # calculating next hash value using previous value
```
Correct code is:
```
else:
    hash_text[i] = ((hash_text[i-1] - ord_text[i-1]) + ord_text[i+len_pattern-1]) # calculating next hash value using previous value
```
