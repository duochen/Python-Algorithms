  This directory contains the source code files for the examples used
in the textbook "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by John
Canning, Alan Broder, and Robert Lafore.  The source files are
organized by the chapter they appear in.  Some sources are repeated in
later chapters where they are imported.

  The Python code uses Python 3 syntax.
